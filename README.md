# Machine Learning Repoitory of Eli Curl

### HW 6
This project was to test the dataset of peoples features(Income, Home Ownership, Income, etc.) to there credit scores.
This was done via checking the accuracy of BaggingClassifier and RandomForestClassifier

### HW 8
This project was to show off a simple ANN.

### HW 4
This project is using SVC to classify different types of glass based on the elements in the glass
Type of glass (class labels):

1: building_windows_float_processed

2: building_windows_non_float_processed

3: vehicle_windows_float_processed

4: vehicle_windows_non_float_processed (not present)

5: containers

6: tableware

7: headlamps

We also use Lasso for Gridsearch to find good alpha values
